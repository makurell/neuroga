selection: input current population, output selected subset of population (intermediate population)
recombination: input ipop, output nextpop
    crossover: input 2 parent NNs, output 2 children NNs
mutation: input NN, output mutated NN


# idea: can make own methods (with params within) and pass them ('operators')
